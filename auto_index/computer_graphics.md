## Courses & Tutorials

### GAMES101

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/computer_graphics/games101/`

GAMES101 is a comprehensive introduction to modern computer graphics course covering:

- Basic mathematics for computer graphics
- Rendering pipeline
- Rasterization algorithms
- Ray tracing
- Animation basics

### Computer Graphics from Scratch

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/computer_graphics/computer_graphics_from_scratch/reading_note.md`

Notes on the "Computer Graphics from Scratch" book which covers:

- Building a software renderer from first principles
- Implementing rasterization algorithms
- Basic ray tracing implementation
- No external libraries approach to understanding the fundamentals

## Technologies & APIs

### OpenGL

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/openGL/`

OpenGL is a cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

### GLSL

**Mentioned in**: `/02learning_notes/Z-TODO.md`

GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) programming is mentioned as a learning goal in your TODO list, often used with C++ for graphics programming.

## Advanced Topics

### Real-Time Graphics

**Related to**: `/02learning_notes/computer_graphics/`

Real-time graphics techniques include:

- Volume graphics (mentioned in TODO with "Real-Time Volume Graphics" book)
- Performance optimization strategies
- Modern rendering techniques

### GPU Programming

**Mentioned in**: `/02learning_notes/Z-TODO.md`

Notes on GPU programming and CG language studies ("GPU 编程与 CG 语言之阳春白雪下里巴人").

## Learning Roadmap

From your TODO file (`/02learning_notes/Z-TODO.md`), the Computer Graphics learning roadmap includes:

1. **Foundational courses**:

   - GAMES101
   - Computer Graphics from Scratch

2. **Core textbooks**:

   - "Real-Time Volume Graphics"
   - The "Tiger book" (likely refers to the "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" by Marschner and Shirley)

3. **Programming skills**:

   - OpenGL & GLSL
   - C++ for graphics programming

4. **Advanced techniques**:
   - GPU programming
   - Graphics shader languages

This roadmap establishes a comprehensive path from computer graphics fundamentals to advanced rendering techniques.
