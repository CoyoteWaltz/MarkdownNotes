## Compiled Languages

### Rust

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/rust/`

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Your planned learning resources include:

- [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Learn Rust 101](https://github.com/plabayo/learn-rust-101)

### C++

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/cpp/`

C++ is a high-performance language commonly used in systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

Notable notes:

- Modern C++ techniques - `/02learning_notes/cpp/cpp_on_the_fly.md`
- OpenGL & GLSL integration (mentioned in TODO)

### Go

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/golang/`

Go (Golang) is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrent programming.

Resources:

- [Go history](https://github.com/golang-design/history) (referenced in TODO)
- Common mistakes in Go - reference to "100 Go mistakes" in collections

### Haskell

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/haskell/`

A purely functional programming language with strong static typing and lazy evaluation.

## Interpreted Languages

### Python

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/python/`

Python is a versatile high-level language valued for readability and broad ecosystem.

### JavaScript/TypeScript

**Found in**:

- `/02learning_notes/front_end_notes/`
- `/08reading/You-Dont-Know-JS-2nd-ed/`
- `/08reading/jshistory-cn/`

JavaScript is the primary language for web development, with TypeScript adding static typing.

Learning resources:

- You Don't Know JS book series
- JavaScript history notes
- RxJS (mentioned in TODO)
- React hooks deep dive (mentioned in TODO)

## Functional Programming

### Haskell (Functional)

**Path**: `/02learning_notes/haskell/`

As a pure functional language, Haskell is excellent for learning functional programming paradigms.

### OCaml

**Status**: Planned learning (referenced in TODO)

Resources marked for learning:

- [OCaml Textbook](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html)
- [OCaml Introduction](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/281438925)
- [Functional Programming Practice](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
