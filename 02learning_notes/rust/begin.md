## installation

Through `rustup`

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Check rust compiler `rustc`

```bash
rustc --version
```

update `rustup update`

uninstall `rustup self uninstall`

### hello rust

```rust filename="main.rs"
fn main() {
	println!("Helldddo, world!");
}
```

build: `rustc main.rs`

exec: `./main`

### Cargo

```bash
cargo --version
```

Creating a project with cargo

```bash
cargo new hello_cargo
```

Default with git `--vcs=git`(VCS version control system)

#### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```

#### Build and run

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

or just run code

```bash
cargo run
```

Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in theÂ *target/debug*Â directory.

#### build release

`cargo build --release`Â to compile it with optimizations.

create executable in `target/release`. Run your program faster but more time on compilation.

#### Cargo as Convention

Officially Nice.

Cargo knows semantic version very well.

`cargo update` will only check the available versions about the semantic version.

`cargo doc --open`Â command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser.

## Basic

### Variables and Mutability

**by default, variables are immutable.**

once a value is bound to a name, you canâ€™t change that value.

Why immutable? Hard to track if a part of code change another's value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;  // error
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Mutability can be very useful. Use `mut` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;  // ok
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

#### Constants

`const` keyword (`mut` is not allowed)

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

Constants may be set only to a constant expression, **not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime**.

Naming convention for constants is ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

#### Shadowing

U can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable.

```rust
fn main() {
	let x = 5;
	let x = x + 1;
	{
		let x = x * 2;
		println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}"); // 12
	}
	println!("The value of x is: {x}"); // 6
}
```

Shadowing is different from marking a variable asÂ `mut`.

By usingÂ `let`, **we can perform a few transformations** on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

We can change the type but reuse the same name.

```rust
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();

```

We dont have to use different name such as `spaces_num`.

### Data Types

scalar and compound.

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If no `:u32` which specify the type, Rust will display err because compiler needs more information about the type.

#### Scaler

**Integer Types**

i8~i128(or `u`)

Each signed variant can store numbers from .., whereÂ *n*Â is the number of bits that variant uses. So anÂ `i8`Â can store numbers from -(27) to 27Â - 1, which equals -128 to 127.

arch? `isize` or `usize` depend on the architecture of the computer(64 / 32 bit architecture)

We can use `_` to make number easier to read `1_000`

integer types default toÂ `i32`.

**Integer Overflow**

- In debug mode:
  - Rust will check integer overflow and _panic_
- In release mode(with `--release`)
  - Rust will not include check and panic, but perform _twoâ€™s complement wrapping_.
    - Greater than maximum â†’ wrap around to the minimum(for `u8`, 256 â†’ 0, 257 â†’ 1)
    - To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow
      - all modes with theÂ `wrapping_*`Â methods

**floating-point**

`f32` and `f64`(default)

**Boolean**

Booleans are one byte in size.

**Character**

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

Use single quotes! 4 bytes in size.

#### Compound Types

**Tuple Type**

With a fixed length.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("Test Tuple {}", tup.0);
println!("Test Tuple x {}, y {}, x {}", x, y, z);
```

**Array**

Fixed length. Same type of the elements. Allocate data on the stack.

Like Array in c/c++? **Vector** type allows to grow and shrink in size.

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Define a repeated array.

```rust
let five_three = [3; 5]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

Rust will panic if the index is out of the range. And that is _memory safe_ in Rust. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, **invalid memory can be accessed**.

### Functions

_snake caseÂ as the conventional style_: `name_convention`

The order of defining functions doesn't matter as long as it is called with the scope.

**Statements & Expressions is distinct in Rust!**

- **Statements**Â are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.(Do sth)
  - which means assignment doesn't return a value. `let x = (let y = 6);` will fail to compile
- **Expressions**Â evaluate to a resultant value.
  - a function call is an expression

```rust
let y = {
	let x = 3;
	x + 1
};
// if you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
```

Functions return type must be declare by `->`. Return value can be the final **expression** of the function or use `return`.

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
	5   // no `;` so it's an expression
}
```

BTW, Rust compiler is friendly haha.

### Control Flow

#### `if` expression

There is no implicit type conversion in Rust!( in javascript if (1) or if (!'')).

if is an expression, so it can be used to assign value. (Each block should be the same type. Variables must have a single type.)

```rust
let real_time = if time > 1 { 10 } else { 0 };
```

#### loops

Rust has three kinds of loops:Â `loop`,Â `while`, andÂ `for`.

**loop**

```rust
fn loop_fn(time: i32) {
    let mut i = 0;
    loop {
        if i > time {
            break;  // jump out of loop until u tell
        }
        i += 1;
      	// continue;
        println!("in the loop, {}", i);
    }
}
```

loop with return value

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");  // 20
}
```

**Conditional Loops with `while`**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

**for in collect**

```rust

fn buy_four() {
    let items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    for item in items {
        println!("buy {}", item);
    }
}
```

use a `Range`, provided by the standard library, which generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.

```rust
fn buy_four() {
    let items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    for item in items {
        for i in (1..20).rev() {  // prettier simple
            println!("buy {} with {}", item, i);
        }
    }
}
```
