# Resume

> I'm a software engineer based in **Barcelona 🌊** with 10 years of experience in the software industry.

My focus area for the past few years has been front-end development with React, but I'm also skilled in back-end development with Go. I am very quality-conscious because I spent my early career years in QA roles.

# 🛠 Skills

## 💻 Technology

### Javascript ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it for over 6 years. I've used it in the front-end with React and Redux, in the back-end for APIs with Node, Express and Hapi.js and for testing automation using Mocha and later on, Jest.

### Golang ⭐️

I've started learning it recently and found it challenging (in a good way!) I'm not proficient yet but I've worked on some features and fixes on my own.

### Technical writing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I enjoy writing about technical subjects and I feel I can do a pretty good job about it! My motivation is explaining things in simple and practical terms and thus making things easier for others.
